# Micro Frontends with App Router
This project merges two Next.js apps into a single site. Each app has its own dependencies and runs independently.

To start the `/home` run the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
cd home
npm install && npm run dev
```

The `/home` app should be up and running in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

Starting the `/blog` app follows a very similar process. In a new terminal, run the following commands from the root directory :

```bash
cd blog
npm install && npm run dev
```

The `blog` app should be up and running in [http://localhost:4000/blog](http://localhost:4000/blog)!
